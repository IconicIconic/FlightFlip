    <h1>FlightFlip - Rules and Regulations</h1>

    <div class="rules-container">
        <!-- Rule 1: Name Change on Tickets -->
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>1. Name Change on Tickets</h2>
            <p>Before selling or transferring any airline ticket, it is your responsibility to verify with the airline or a licensed travel agent whether the ticket is eligible for a name change. FlightFlip is not responsible for any issues or complications related to name changes or any inability to change the name on a ticket. All name change requests must be handled directly with the airline or an authorized travel agent.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Rule 2: Responsibility for Ticket Information -->
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>2. Accuracy of Ticket Information</h2>
            <p>You are solely responsible for providing accurate and up-to-date information about your airline tickets. FlightFlip is not liable for any discrepancies between the information you provide and the actual details of the ticket (e.g., departure times, destination, airline, etc.). Inaccurate information can result in the rejection of your listing, cancellation of your sale, or legal consequences. Please double-check all details before submitting a ticket for sale.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Rule 3: FlightFlip's Role as a Platform -->
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>3. FlightFlip's Role as a Platform</h2>
            <p>FlightFlip is a peer-to-peer platform that connects buyers and sellers of unused airline tickets. FlightFlip does not guarantee the validity of any tickets listed for sale, nor does it take responsibility for the transaction between the buyer and seller. FlightFlip merely acts as an intermediary by providing the platform for individuals to connect. We do not handle payments or ticket transfer logistics.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Rule 4: Ticket Fraud and Misrepresentation -->
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>4. Fraudulent Listings and Misrepresentation</h2>
            <p>It is strictly prohibited to list tickets that are fraudulent, invalid, or misrepresented in any way. This includes, but is not limited to, listing tickets that have already been used, are non-transferable, or are part of a loyalty or rewards program. Any attempt to defraud other users will result in immediate suspension of your account, and legal action may be taken. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless FlightFlip from any claims related to fraudulent or misleading listings.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Rule 5: User Behavior and Code of Conduct -->
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>5. User Behavior and Code of Conduct</h2>
            <p>All users of FlightFlip are expected to behave in a respectful and lawful manner. Harassment, discrimination, or any other behavior that violates the rights of others will not be tolerated. Users are prohibited from posting offensive or harmful content, engaging in fraudulent activities, or attempting to manipulate the platform for personal gain. Violators may face account suspension or permanent removal from the platform.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Rule 6: Ticket Transfer and Airline Policies -->
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>6. Airline Policies on Ticket Transfers</h2>
            <p>Each airline has its own policies regarding the transfer of tickets. It is the responsibility of the seller to ensure that the ticket can be legally transferred to another person. FlightFlip does not guarantee that any ticket listed for sale is eligible for transfer. You are required to check with the airline regarding the transferability of tickets and ensure the buyer is able to use the ticket before completing the sale.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Rule 7: Transaction Disputes -->
        <div class="rule">
            <h2>7. Transaction Disputes</h2>
            <p>FlightFlip is not responsible for resolving disputes between buyers and sellers. If a transaction is disputed or there is a disagreement, we recommend that both parties try to resolve the issue directly. FlightFlip will not intervene in disputes, nor will we mediate between parties. Users are advised to retain records of all communications and transactions in case of a dispute. If you believe you have been defrauded, please contact the relevant authorities or the airline directly.</p>
